Quantum-Immune Windows Security Suite v2.1
Overview
The Quantum-Immune Windows Security Suite is a comprehensive security framework designed to provide post-quantum cryptographic protection and application sandboxing for Windows systems. It integrates modern cryptographic algorithms, TPM-based attestation, and process isolation to create a secure execution environment.

Key Features
Quantum-Resistant Cryptography: Supports Kyber (KEM) and Dilithium (signatures) algorithms

Secure Application Execution: Sandboxing with configurable isolation levels

TPM Integration: Platform attestation and secure measurements

Threat Intelligence: Integration with threat intelligence services

Cryptographic Agility: Automatic algorithm rotation for forward secrecy

System Requirements
Windows 10/11 (64-bit)

Python 3.8+

TPM 2.0 (recommended)

Administrator privileges for full functionality

Installation
Install Python 3.8+ from python.org

Install required dependencies:

bash
pip install cryptography>=38.0.0 pywin32>=300 pycryptodome>=3.15.0
For quantum-resistant cryptography (optional):

bash
pip install python-kyber>=1.0.0 dilithium-python>=1.0.0
Clone or download the repository

Usage
Basic Operation
python
from quantum import QuantumImmuneSecuritySuite, AppPolicy, CryptoAlgorithms, SandboxLevel

# Initialize the security suite
suite = QuantumImmuneSecuritySuite()
suite.start()

# Create a security policy
policy = AppPolicy(
    crypto_level=CryptoAlgorithms.KYBER_768,  # Use quantum-resistant crypto
    sandbox_level=SandboxLevel.FULL_ISOLATION,
    require_attestation=True
)

# Register and execute an application
app_path = "C:\\path\\to\\your\\application.exe"
if suite.register_application(app_path, policy):
    suite.execute_application(app_path)
Configuration
The security suite automatically creates a configuration file at:

text
%ProgramData%\QuantumImmune\config.json
Example configuration:

json
{
  "crypto_rotation_interval": 3600,
  "default_sandbox_level": "FULL_ISOLATION",
  "require_attestation": true,
  "threat_intel_server": "https://intel.quantumimmune.com/api/v1"
}
Security Policies
Cryptographic Algorithms
Algorithm	Type	Quantum-Resistant
KYBER_768	KEM	Yes
DILITHIUM_3	Signatures	Yes
X25519	KEM	No
ECDSA_P384	Signatures	No
Sandbox Levels
Level	Description
BASIC_ISOLATION	Process isolation and job control
NETWORK_RESTRICTION	Limited network access
FILESYSTEM_VIRTUALIZATION	Virtualized filesystem access
FULL_ISOLATION	All restrictions combined
Logging
The security suite logs all activities to:

Console output

File: security_suite.log in the current directory

Troubleshooting
Missing Dependencies:

Verify all required packages are installed

Check the log for specific missing modules

TPM Errors:

Ensure TPM is enabled in BIOS

Verify TPM 2.0 is available

Permission Issues:

Run as Administrator when registering applications

Check Windows security policies
